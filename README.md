# flutterwidget

A new Flutter project for 2023 may widget practise and learn

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
The RichText widget is used to display text that uses various different styles. The displayed text is described using a tree of TextSpan objects, each of which has its own associated style that is used for that subtree. Depending on the layout constraints the text might break across multiple lines or might all be displayed on the same line.
